description: >
    Protecting the communication and data infrastructure of an increasingly inter-connected world has become vital to the normal functioning of all aspects of our world. Security has emerged as an important scientific discipline whose many multifaceted complexities deserve the attention and synergy of the mathematical, computer science and engineering communities. After the previous meetings held in La Rochelle, Montréal, Grenoble, Toronto and Paris, this 8th edition of the FPS symposium will be held in Clermont-Ferrand, France. The aim of FPS is to discuss and exchange theoretical and practical ideas that address security issues in inter-connected systems. It aims to provide scientific presentations as well as to establish links, promote scientific collaboration, joint research programs, and student exchanges between institutions involved in this important and fast moving research field.
