### Steve Kremer, Inria Nancy Grand-Est & Loria, Cassis team
Formal, symbolic techniques for modelling and automatically analyzing security protocols are extremely successful and were able to discover many security flaws. Initially, these techniques were mainly developed to analyze authentication and confidentiality properties. Both these properties are trace properties and efficient tools for their verification exist. In more recent years anonymity-like properties have received increasing interest. Many flavors of anonymity properties are naturally expressed in terms of indistinguishability and modeled as an observational equivalence in process calculi. We will present recent advances in the verification of such indistinguishability properties and illustrate their usefulness on examples from electronic voting.
