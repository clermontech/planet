### [David Hely](http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr/membres-+/david-hely--285755.kjsp?RH=LCIS2_CTSYS-MEM), [LCSI](http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr/le-laboratoire/)
Lifetime security of modern system on chip can be jeopardized by instruments dedicated to test and debug. On one hand, security objectives require that assets (third party IP, secure boot, DRM key…) remain confidential throughout the SoC life-cycle. On the other hand, the test circuitry and the SoC trace-based debug architecture expose values of internal signals that can leak the assets to third-parties. The inherent capability of test and debug instruments to observe the operating state of the SoC can be leveraged as a backdoor for attacks. In this talk, we show the different kinds of attacks which can be mounted based on these features through the whole SoC life cycle (from production to software application debug). We then present different countermeasures which aims at protecting assets belonging to the different stakeholders (IC designer, SoC integrator, Software developers…). Finally, we show how this circuitry dedicated to test and debug can be leverage on purpose during mission mode to offer security services to the software developers.
